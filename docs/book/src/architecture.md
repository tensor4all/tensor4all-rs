# Architecture & Crate Guide

This page describes how tensor4all-rs is organised, what each crate does, how to
choose the right crate for your use case, and the two-stack design that keeps
the public API predictable.

## Two stacks, no facade

The workspace is organised as **two independent stacks**. Each stack owns its
tensor-train representation and its algorithm crates. There is **no facade
crate** that wraps everything: `tensor4all-capi` is a C FFI layer, not a Rust
facade, and each crate can be used on its own.

### The sanctioned crossing: `treetn::simplett_bridge`

The only sanctioned place where the two stacks convert into each other is
`treetn::simplett_bridge`:

- `tensor_train_to_treetn` / `tensor_train_to_treetn_with_names` /
  `tensor_train_to_treetn_with_names_and_site_indices`: simplett
  `SimpleTensorTrain` -> network `TreeTN`;
- `treetn_to_tensor_train`: network `TreeTN` (linear chain) -> simplett
  `SimpleTensorTrain`;
- `fix_and_remove_site_from_treetn_chain`,
  `insert_onehot_site_in_treetn_chain`,
  `weighted_remove_site_from_treetn_chain`: chain-topology helpers.

Crates that need to cross stacks must route through this bridge. New ad hoc
bridges (hand-rolled conversion logic inside another crate) are rejected.
`tensor4all-partitionedtt` consumes simplett output (TCI2 results) only via
`tensor_train_to_treetn`; the TreeTN-native `tensor4all-partitionedtreetn`
operates directly on named `TreeTN<IdxTensor, V>` values and does not depend on
simplett, itensorlike, or TCI crates.

One deliberate exception exists: `tensor4all-quanticstransform` builds
TreeTN-based `LinearOperator`s from simplett **MPO** data (two site indices
per node) via `tensortrain_to_linear_operator`. That is operator construction,
not a general stack conversion: the bridge stays MPS-shaped (one site index
per node), and the transform layer keeps the MPO-specific index bookkeeping.
No *new* ad hoc conversions may be added; MPO conversion belongs in the
transform layer, and MPS conversion belongs in the bridge.

### Which stack does a new feature crate target?

- **Application-level features** (operators, evolution, DMRG, TDVP, algorithm
  composition on a known topology) target the **network stack** by default
  (`tensor4all-treetn`, or `tensor4all-itensorlike` when ITensors.jl-style
  semantics are wanted).
- **Numerical-core features** (cross interpolation, factorizations, quantics
  kernels) target the **simplett stack** by default
  (`tensor4all-simplett`, `tensor4all-tensorci`; the former
  `tensor4all-tcicore` was dissolved into `tensor4all-core`, #639).
- A feature that must serve both stacks is implemented in the target stack
  and exposed through `treetn::simplett_bridge`; it is not duplicated in both.

## Vocabulary conventions

Beyond the naming-policy suffixes (`_mut`, `_into`, `_batched`), the following
operation names are unified across crates:

- **Inner product**: `inner_product` everywhere. (`dot` was retired in
  `tensor4all-simplett`.)
- **Densification**: `full_tensor` materializes a tensor train/MPO into a flat
  column-major buffer plus shape; `to_dense` materializes a single tensor into
  a dense `IdxTensor`. The distinction is intentional (whole-TT vs
  one-tensor).
- **Canonicalization**: `treetn` uses `canonicalize` / `canonicalize_mut`;
  `itensorlike` uses `orthogonalize` (ITensors.jl-compatible vocabulary) for
  the same center-site normalization. Each stack keeps its standard term; do
  not introduce a third synonym.
- **Options**: bond caps use `max_bond_dim: Option<usize>`; truncation
  tolerances use `SvdTruncationPolicy` (`rtol`/`cutoff`); sweep counts use
  `nfullsweeps`/`nsweeps` (TreeTN) or `nhalfsweeps` (itensorlike) as documented
  in the skills guide.

## `TensorTrain` naming resolution

Two different types are named `TensorTrain`-family, which is the historical
naming trap that PR 3 resolves:

| Type | Crate | Representation | Use when |
|------|-------|----------------|----------|
| `SimpleTensorTrain<T>` | `tensor4all-simplett` | positional cores (`Tensor3<T>`), no named indices | lightweight create/evaluate/compress |
| `TensorTrain` | `tensor4all-itensorlike` | `TreeTN<IdxTensor, usize>` wrapper with orthogonality tracking | ITensors.jl-style interface |

Rules:

- `tensor4all-simplett::SimpleTensorTrain` is the **positional** chain type.
  Prefer it for numerical kernels.
- `tensor4all-itensorlike::TensorTrain` is the **tree-based** chain type with
  named indices, canonical forms, and orthogonality tracking.
- There are no compatibility aliases: `TensorTrain` alone always means the
  itensorlike type inside that crate, and simplett code must write
  `SimpleTensorTrain`.

The corresponding errors follow the representation names:

| Error | Owner | Covers |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `tensor4all_simplett::SimpleTensorTrainError` | `SimpleTensorTrain` | positional shapes, flat indices, and MatrixCI failures |
| `tensor4all_itensorlike::TensorTrainError` | itensorlike `TensorTrain` | named indices, TreeTN structure, orthogonality, and factorization |

They are deliberately separate because combining them would couple the two
independent stacks. The distinct names prevent ambiguous imports.

## Scalar capability boundaries

Scalar traits are layered capabilities rather than interchangeable numeric
aliases:

| Capability | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `tensor4all_core::Scalar` | common value arithmetic and conversion |
| `tensor4all_core::MatrixLuciScalar` | core `Scalar` plus MatrixLUCI backend dispatch |
| `tensor4all_tensorbackend::TensorElement` | supported Rust scalar ↔ native tensor conversion |
| `tensor4all_tensorbackend::StorageScalar` | compact storage construction |
| tensorbackend matrix/linalg traits | individual backend kernel capabilities |
| `tensor4all_simplett::TTScalar` | positional tensor-train arithmetic requirements |
| ACI/TreeACI scalar traits | sealed algorithm-supported types and algorithm-only operations |

`tensor4all_core::AnyScalar` is the only public `AnyScalar`; it may retain an
AD-tracked rank-0 tensor. The internal tensorbackend value is named `BackendScalar`
and is an untracked compact scalar. Do not replace these capability boundaries
with one all-purpose supertrait: that would force storage and algorithm
requirements onto unrelated generic code.

## Layer descriptions

### Foundation (internal)

| Crate | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **tensorbackend** | *Internal.* Compact `f64`/`Complex64` storage, four-dtype eager tensor bridges, and tenferro-backed primitives. Users do not need to depend on this crate directly. |
| **core** | Foundation for everything else. Provides the `Index` system, dynamic-rank `Tensor`, contraction, and SVD/QR/LU factorizations. |

### Network stack

| Crate | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **treetn** | Tree tensor networks with arbitrary graph topology. Supports canonicalization, truncation, contraction, DMRG/TDVP, and hosts the sanctioned `simplett_bridge`. |

| **partitionedtreetn** | TreeTN-native eagerly masked subdomains, strict partition algebra, and volume-budgeted adaptive patching. |
| **partitionedtt** | **Deprecated** partitioned tensor trains for subdomain decomposition. Builds on itensorlike and crosses to simplett via `simplett_bridge`; it remains buildable during migration. |
| **treetci** | Tree TCI: cross interpolation on tree-structured tensor networks. |

### Simplett stack

| Crate | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **simplett** | Lightweight positional tensor train (`SimpleTensorTrain`) for numerical computation. |

| **tensor4all-py** | PyO3 bindings for Python (prototype). Not a workspace member; see its `README.md`. |

## Which crate should I use?

| Goal | Recommended crate |
|------|-------------------|

| Legacy simple TT subdomain decomposition or adaptive TCI | `tensor4all-partitionedtt` (deprecated during migration) |
| Quantics transform operators | `tensor4all-quanticstransform` |
| HDF5 I/O compatible with Julia | `tensor4all-hdf5` |
| Interpolative QTT on a coarse grid | `tensor4all-interpolativeqtt` |
| Elementwise TT ops via ACI | `tensor4all-aci` |

## Error remedies

Public error types use `thiserror`, preserve the source error, carry
structured fields, and name an actionable remedy in the rustdoc when one is
documented. Recurring cases avoid opaque string payloads. `cargo clippy` is
configured with `-D clippy::missing_errors_doc -D clippy::missing_panics_doc`
so every fallible or panicking public function documents its failure modes.

## Internal crates

`tensor4all-tensorbackend` is an implementation detail. The former
`tensor4all-tcicore` crate was dissolved into `tensor4all-core` (#639): the
matrix CI / LUCI / rrLU algorithms, `CachedFunction`, and `MultiIndex` now
live in core. These are still not part of the application-facing public API
surface and their interfaces may change without notice.
