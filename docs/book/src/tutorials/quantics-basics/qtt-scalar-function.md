# QTT of a Scalar Function

This tutorial builds a quantics tensor train (QTT) for one scalar function on a
small binary grid. A QTT stores the values on `2^R` grid points as `R` small
sites. The bond dimensions are the internal sizes between neighboring
sites; larger values can carry more information but cost more memory and time.

Runnable source: [`docs/tutorial-code/src/bin/qtt_function.rs`](../../../../tutorial-code/src/bin/qtt_function.rs)

## Key API Pieces

Use `quanticscrossinterpolate_discrete` when the function is most naturally
written in terms of grid indices.

```rust
# fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
# use tensor4all_quanticstci::{
#     quanticscrossinterpolate_discrete, QtciOptions, UnfoldingScheme,
# };
let npoints = 128usize;
let sizes = [npoints];
let f = move |idx: &[i64]| -> f64 {
    let x = (idx[0] as f64 - 1.0) / npoints as f64;
    x.cosh()
};
let options = QtciOptions::default()
    .with_unfoldingscheme(UnfoldingScheme::Interleaved)
    .with_verbosity(0);

let (qtt, ranks, _errors) =
    quanticscrossinterpolate_discrete::<f64, _>(&sizes, f, None, options)?;

let x = 0.5_f64;
assert!((qtt.evaluate(&[65])? - x.cosh()).abs() < 1e-8);
assert!(!ranks.is_empty());
# Ok(())
# }
```

The tutorial binary uses the same target function, `cosh(x)`, and adds CSV
output for plotting.

## What It Computes

The example samples a smooth one-dimensional function, compresses the samples
with tensor cross interpolation, evaluates the QTT back on the grid, and writes
CSV data for the plots below. In this tutorial the function is `cosh(x)` on
`x in [0, 1)`.

The points from the QTT lie on top of the direct function values. The next plot
shows the bond dimensions along the QTT chain. In examples with a visible peak,
that peak would mean that part of the grid needs more internal information than
its neighbors.
