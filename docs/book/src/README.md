# tensor4all-rs

tensor4all-rs is a Rust implementation of tensor network algorithms, focused on:

- **Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI / TCI2)** — adaptive low-rank tensor approximation
- **Quantics Tensor Train (QTT)** — representation of functions in exponentially fine grids
- **Tree Tensor Networks (TreeTN)** — tensor networks with arbitrary tree topology

The library is structured as a workspace of independent crates under `crates/`, designed for modular use and AI-agentic development workflows. Language bindings for Julia are provided through the C API layer.

Source code and issue tracker: [github.com/tensor4all/tensor4all-rs](https://github.com/tensor4all/tensor4all-rs)

The repository root `README.md` stays intentionally concise. Longer runnable
examples live in this guide and the guide examples are exercised in CI.

## Feature highlights

- **Dynamic Index/Tensor system** inspired by ITensors.jl: indices carry semantic identity, tensor contraction aligns axes by index rather than position
- **Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI2)**: approximates high-dimensional tensors from a small number of evaluations using cross-approximation
- **Quantics Tensor Train (QTT)**: represents smooth functions on exponentially fine grids; includes transformation operators (affine, shift, sum)
- **Tree Tensor Networks**: arbitrary-topology TTN, not limited to chains (MPS/MPO); supports standard MPS/MPO as special cases with runtime topology checks
- **C API** (`tensor4all-capi`): stable FFI surface for language bindings, currently used by [Tensor4all.jl](https://github.com/tensor4all/Tensor4all.jl)

## Not sure where you fit?

If you are new to the library, read [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for a short working example, then consult [Concepts](concepts.md) for background on the data structures used throughout.
