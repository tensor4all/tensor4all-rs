# Provenance and Citation Policy

This document records which tensor4all-rs components build on which external
projects, which implemented algorithms originate in which publications, and
how we ask research users to cite them. We maintain it because modern
development, human or AI-assisted, makes it easy to write one codebase while
referencing another, and the scientific contribution of the referenced
projects deserves visible credit beyond what licenses require. When a new
component references external code, designs, or published algorithms, add it
here in the same PR.

## Citation policy

Citations should reflect the full lineage of the methods you use, not only
the topmost software layer. This is a permanent style, not a stopgap: when a
tensor4all-rs software paper appears, it will be added to the list below in
addition to, not in place of, the upstream citations.

- Cite the original papers of the algorithms your work relies on (see
  "Algorithm origins" below).
- Cite the software papers of the upstream libraries whose designs the
  components you use are ported from or build on: the TCI paper
  ([SciPost Phys. 18, 104 (2025)](https://doi.org/10.21468/SciPostPhys.18.3.104))
  for the TCI components, and the ITensor paper
  ([SciPost Phys. Codebases 4 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.21468/SciPostPhysCodeb.4))
  for the tree tensor network components.
- Check the citation policies of those upstream projects themselves and
  apply them recursively: an upstream library may in turn ask you to cite
  further method papers (for example, ITensor asks DMRG users to also cite
  the original DMRG papers). The component table below tells you which
  upstream policies are relevant to the components you use.
- tensor4all-rs itself does not yet have a software paper; if you need to
  reference it directly, cite the repository URL and the version or commit
  you used.

## Component provenance

This table records intellectual provenance (designs, algorithms, and code
lineage), not the Cargo dependency graph; see each crate's `Cargo.toml` for
actual dependencies. Relationship vocabulary:

- **Port**: reimplementation of a specific upstream library, following its
  public API and algorithms.
- **Derived (license)**: contains code translated closely enough from the
  upstream to carry its license terms.
- **Inspired**: data structures or API design modeled on the upstream;
  implementation independent.
- **Compatible**: interoperates with the upstream's conventions or file
  formats; validated against it.
- **Backend**: delegates execution to the upstream (in this one case the
  upstream is also an actual dependency).

Components with more than one provenance relationship get one row per
relationship; the role is stated only on the first row.

## Algorithm origins

Library provenance above is distinct from the scientific origin of the
algorithms themselves. Where an implemented algorithm has an identifiable
original publication, research using that component should cite it. This
list is best-effort; corrections and additions are welcome.
