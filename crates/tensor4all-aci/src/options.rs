/// Use this type to choose iteration limits, truncation pressure, stopping
/// tolerance, and an optional initial tensor-train guess. The default values are
/// conservative: they run at least two sweeps, allow up to twenty sweeps, do not
/// cap bond dimensions, and use an absolute tolerance of `1e-12`.

/// Related types: [`AciResult`](crate::AciResult) stores the tensor train and
/// convergence history produced by an ACI run, while [`ElementwiseBatch`](crate::ElementwiseBatch)
/// describes batched column-major operator inputs.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use tensor4all_aci::AciOptions;
///
/// let options = AciOptions::<f64>::default();
/// assert_eq!(options.max_iters, 20);
/// assert_eq!(options.min_iters, 2);
/// assert_eq!(options.max_bond_dim, usize::MAX);
/// assert!((options.tolerance - 1e-12).abs() < 1e-15);
/// assert!(!options.scale_tolerance);
/// assert!(options.initial_guess.is_none());
/// assert_eq!(options.rng_seed, 0);
