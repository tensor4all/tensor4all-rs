//! Result types returned by Alternating Cross Interpolation.

/// Output of an Alternating Cross Interpolation run.
///
/// The result contains the approximating tensor train plus convergence metadata
/// collected during the run. Use [`tensor_train`](Self::tensor_train) for
/// subsequent tensor-train operations, and inspect [`ranks`](Self::ranks) and
/// [`errors`](Self::errors) to diagnose sweep-by-sweep convergence behavior.
///
/// Related types: [`AciOptions`](crate::AciOptions) configures the run that
/// produces this value; [`TensorTrain`] stores the approximating tensor.

/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use tensor4all_aci::AciResult;
/// use tensor4all_simplett::{AbstractTensorTrain, TensorTrain};
///
/// let tensor_train = TensorTrain::<f64>::constant(&[2, 3], 4.0);
/// let result = AciResult {
///     tensor_train,
///     ranks: vec![1, 2],
///     errors: vec![1e-3, 0.0],
