//! TensorIndex trait for index operations on tensor-like objects.
//!
//! This trait provides a minimal interface for objects that have external indices
//! and support index replacement operations. It is a subset of `TensorLike` that
//! can be implemented by both dense tensors and tensor networks (like TreeTN).

/// Trait for objects that have external indices and support index operations.
///
/// This is a minimal trait that can be implemented by:
/// - Dense tensors (`TensorDynLen`)
/// - Tensor networks (`TreeTN`)
/// - Any other structure that organizes tensors with indices
///
/// # Design
///
/// This trait is separate from `TensorLike` to allow tensor networks to implement
/// index operations without needing to implement contraction/factorization operations.
