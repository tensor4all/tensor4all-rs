//! Partitioned Tree Tensor Network subdomains for tensor4all.
//!
//! This crate provides [`Projector`], [`SubDomainTreeTN`], and
//! [`PartitionedTreeTN`] patch algebra, including TreeTN-general adaptive
//! patching. Stored patch data is eagerly masked, and partition metadata is
//! validated transactionally.
//!
//! The representation follows the partitioned tensor-network approach used by
//! [PartitionedMPSs.jl](https://github.com/tensor4all/PartitionedMPSs.jl) and
//! the adaptive patching literature; this crate does not contain TCI-derived
//! adaptive interpolation code.
