## Public Boundary Safety Audits

- User-reachable Rust, tensor-network, C API, and binding-facing paths validate
  input-derived shape, rank, axis, index, dtype/scalar kind, topology,
  truncation, and layout configuration before no-op shortcuts, allocation,
  backend calls, pointer use, or FFI calls.
- Shape products, dense element counts, byte lengths, strides, offsets, bond
  products, launch sizes, and FFI dimensions use checked arithmetic before
  conversion to `usize`, `i32`, `u32`, pointer offsets, or allocation sizes.
- Publicly reachable library paths never turn invalid user input into `panic`,
  `unwrap`, `expect`, unchecked indexing, poisoned-lock unwraps, or debug-only
  assertions. Return a crate-local typed error or a C API status with preserved
  diagnostic context.
- Fast paths and zero-size returns get the same scrutiny as the main path: a
  shortcut must not skip rank, index identity, scalar kind, topology, or layout
  checks the full path would apply.
- Validation shared by Rust, C API, Julia/Python bindings, dense,
  tensor-network, or scalar-specific wrappers should live in shared helpers or
  prepared metadata types. Do not duplicate hand-written checks when a helper
  can enforce the contract before unsafe or performance-sensitive code. Helpers
  should return typed prepared metadata when downstream code would otherwise
  repeat rank-minus-one, axis ordering, shape-product, site role, edge role, or
  index mapping calculations.
- Parallel operation surfaces keep validation and scalar-promotion semantics in
  parity. A bug in one of Rust/C API, f64/Complex64, dense/TN, or MPS/MPO-like
  wrappers should trigger a nearby audit of the corresponding surfaces.
- When a bug exposes a public API design mismatch, fix the canonical contract at
  its owner. API compatibility is not a goal in this early-development
  repository unless the task explicitly requires a compatibility window.

## Base Branch Synchronization

- Start work from the current remote base: `git fetch origin`, then branch or
  create worktrees from `origin/main`, never a stale local checkout.
- Before treating PR checks as final, fetch `origin` and verify the PR branch
  contains current `origin/main`. If GitHub reports the PR behind the base,
  update from `origin/main` before relying on checks, enabling auto-merge, or
  declaring it ready.
- After any `origin/main` synchronization, rerun or re-monitor CI; earlier
  green checks are insufficient.

## No Hidden Dense Materialization In Production Paths

- Production algorithms never silently materialize a full dense tensor whose
  memory or time scales as the product of unconstrained site or external index
  dimensions.
- Scalable public paths (tensor-network contraction, operator apply,
  truncation, fitting, C API entry points, binding-facing APIs) avoid hidden
  calls to full-network materialization such as `contract_to_tensor()` or
  `to_dense()` unless the API is explicitly dense or reference.
- Dense/reference implementations are allowed only when explicitly named as
  dense, reference, or debug; documented as O(product of index dimensions) in
  memory/time; excluded from default or production dispatch; and covered by
  small-size tests only.
- Method names match semantics. For MPO/MPS or `LinearOperator` application,
  `naive` means local exact tensor-network contraction, not dense
  materialization, unless the name and docs explicitly say dense/reference.
- If dense materialization is unavoidable for a debugging or reference path,
  prefer an explicit size guard or caller-supplied limit such as
  `max_dense_elements`.
- When adding or changing contraction/application code, check whether any path
  can call `contract_to_tensor()`, `to_dense()`, or equivalent. If so, justify
  that the path is explicitly dense/reference or replace it with a local
  tensor-network algorithm.
- Do not replace structured tensors with dense tensors in production paths when
  the structure is semantically required or already available: identity,
  diagonal, Kronecker delta, copy, one-hot, selector, and bridge tensors used to
  preserve topology or route bond spaces.
- A tensor that is mathematically a delta/copy/identity uses the compact
  structured representation when one exists (diagonal/copy storage, structured
  axis classes). If only a dense constructor exists, add or refine the
  structured core API first, or reject the unbounded production path.
- Topology-preserving helper tensors must not introduce hidden dense
  `bond_dim^2`, `bond_dim^k`, or site-product payloads. Dimension-1 structural
  links are fine; nontrivial bridge deltas keep compact diagonal/copy structure
  or stay behind an explicit dense/reference guard.
- Tests for delta/copy/identity paths should check representation as well as
  numerics where possible: `is_diag()`, `storage_kind()`, payload dimensions, axis
  classes, or a regression that is cheap for the intended algorithm but fails
  under accidental dense storage.

## Tensor Network Test Comparisons

- Randomized algorithms provide both a high-level deterministic seed API and a
  low-level API taking a caller-owned `&mut R` where `R: rand::Rng + ?Sized`.
  The high-level API delegates to the low-level one, which consumes the
  supplied stream directly rather than deriving a seed for a hidden RNG.
- Seed-based production entry points use an explicitly named RNG algorithm, not
  `StdRng`, so dependency upgrades do not silently change the stream.
- Tests of randomized algorithms use `ChaCha8Rng` with an explicit seed, never
  `StdRng`, `thread_rng`, or implicit entropy.
- Small reference tests may materialize dense tensors: materialize each full
  result once, subtract, and compare the whole result with `maxabs()`. Never
  compare by re-contracting or re-evaluating element by element.
- Long-TT or long-TreeTN regression tests are sized so accidental dense
  materialization fails quickly while the intended algorithm stays cheap.
- Long tensor-network tests must not use comparison helpers that
  dense-materialize internally; do not call `maxabs()` on a TT/TN type unless
  that implementation is known to be scalable.
- For long TT/TN equality, prefer scalable comparisons: direct-sum difference
  (`tt1 - tt2` or `axpby(1, tt1, -1, tt2)`) followed by a tensor-network norm;
  sampled `evaluate()` at fixed multi-indices; structural invariants such as
  node count, site indices, and bounded bond dimensions.
- Do not compress a difference TT/TN before using it as an exact test residual.
- With norm-based approximate equality, report the residual explicitly, e.g.
  `diff.norm() / reference.norm()`.

## Online Tutorial Synchronization

- `docs/book/src/tutorials/` is the live source for tutorial prose;
  `docs/tutorial-code/src/bin/` and `docs/tutorial-code/src/` are the runnable
  source for demos and shared helpers.
- Any change to tutorial APIs, tutorial code, generated tutorial artifacts, or
  public APIs used by tutorials updates the corresponding live mdBook page
  before the branch is complete.
- Non-trivial guide snippets should have an executable source of truth
  (checked example, tutorial binary, doctest, or test). If Markdown must copy a
  snippet by hand, add or update a sync/extraction check when practical.
- Diagrams in `README.md`, mdBook, and `docs/design/` are documented surface:
  crate names, layer assignments, dependency direction, and public entry points
  must match the implementation.
- Legacy markdown under `docs/tutorial-code/docs/tutorials/` is not the online
  source of truth.

## Work Logs And Design Records

- Follow the shared Work Logs And Design Records policy; keep a lightweight
  record for nontrivial multi-phase changes, non-obvious design choices, or
  performance experiments under `docs/worklogs/`. Small fixes and AI assistance
  alone do not require one.
- Use the [work-log format](docs/worklogs/README.md) to record decisions and
  reasons, important alternatives, verification conclusions, and remaining
  constraints, not command histories or lists of files read. Link the record
  from the PR and update it only when those conclusions change.
- When a PR establishes or changes durable design intent, update the relevant
  `docs/design/` document in the same PR. Work logs hold session-level
  rationale; design docs hold decisions future implementation should follow.
- When an audit finding is a false positive because of an intentional
  invariant, record the evidence in the issue, PR body, work log, nearby source
  comment, or source-contract test so future reviewers do not rediscover it.

## Differentiability And AD Preservation

- Production tensor, tensor-network, linear algebra, and solver paths should
  preserve automatic differentiation metadata whenever the backend and
  operation allow.
- Unless documented otherwise, dense tensor operations should go through
  `tensor4all-tensorbackend` or existing tensor4all abstractions that preserve
  tenferro AD metadata. Avoid bypassing the backend with local dense loops,
  native-tensor extraction, host scalar conversion, or detached reference
  implementations.
- Do not unnecessarily detach tensors, convert differentiable values through
  plain Rust scalars, force `.real()`/real-only projections, or round-trip
  through dense/reference paths in ways that discard AD metadata.
- Where an operation must cross a non-differentiable boundary (scalar
  control-flow decision, diagnostic conversion, FFI, unsupported backend
  routine, intentionally native/reference implementation), keep that boundary
  explicit in code and documentation.
- Prefer backend-provided differentiable primitives for contraction, einsum,
  SVD, QR, eigensolvers, exponentials, and scalar operations. If one is
  missing, add or refine the backend/core API instead of a detached local
  workaround.
- Tests claiming AD support include oracle or finite-difference coverage. Tests
  for algorithms not yet AD-supported should still avoid unnecessary AD
  metadata loss along intermediate tensor paths.

## Index Identity Semantics

- Never use `index.id()` alone to decide whether two indices are the same
  object. Identity comparisons use full index equality so same-ID indices with
  different prime levels, tags, directions, or other metadata remain distinct.
- Maps and sets representing index identity are keyed by the full index value,
  not `IndexLike::Id`.
- Public and internal APIs that select a concrete tensor leg, TreeTN site,
  edge, topology assignment, replacement target, split/fuse target, or
  restructure target accept the full `Index` value, not an ID.
- C API and binding-facing APIs follow the same rule: accept `Index` handles
  for concrete selection, expose full-index equality/hash helpers when bindings
  need map keys, and expose no ID-only constructors, selectors, or identity
  getters.
- Pure ID comparisons are allowed only inside implementation details explicitly
  about logical-site lookup, compatibility, or contraction pairing. If a
  temporary internal ID map is unavoidable, name it to make the semantics
  explicit (`logical_site_ids`, `contraction_pair_ids`) and reject ambiguous
  same-ID inputs instead of choosing one silently.
- When changing tensor, TreeTN, contraction, direct-sum, replacement, or
  reindexing code, add a regression test with same-ID indices that differ by
  prime level or tags.

## Unsafe Code Boundary

- `unsafe` belongs in FFI, backend, storage, or other leaf modules owning the
  low-level invariant, never in high-level tensor-network, interpolation,
  graph/topology, transform, or AD-preserving algorithm code when the correct
  fix is a lower-level helper.
- Count and review `unsafe` by location and purpose, not raw text search.
  Generated code, comments, tests, and existing backend/FFI seams should be
  separated from production algorithmic code when auditing risk.
- Each new `unsafe` block has a nearby `// SAFETY:` comment explaining the
  validation or ownership invariant that makes it sound.
- Boundary-condition or source-contract tests should cover new unsafe
  indexing, raw pointer, FFI, or backend-native view construction paths.

## File Organization

- Keep source files focused, but never split solely to reduce line count.
  Roughly 1000 lines is a soft review trigger, not a limit.
- Split only along clear behavior, abstraction, feature, ownership, or
  public/private API boundaries: validation, planning, execution, topology,
  contraction, solver, C API bridge, backend glue, cache ownership. No
  `part1`/`part2` splits and no tiny files that scatter one concept.
- Line count decides where to inspect first; responsibility, change frequency,
  API boundaries, and human navigation decide whether and how to split.

## Language Bindings

- New Julia/Python-facing features that need Rust support should land in
  tensor4all-rs first.
- C API changes should account for downstream Tensor4all.jl compatibility and
  pin updates.
- Python bindings (`crates/tensor4all-py`) call the public Rust APIs directly
  through PyO3; they do not go through the C API. PyO3-specific types and
  conversions live in that crate so the core crates stay Python-independent.
