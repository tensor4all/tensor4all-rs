# tensor4all-rs

[![CI](https://github.com/tensor4all/tensor4all-rs/actions/workflows/CI_rs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tensor4all/tensor4all-rs/actions/workflows/CI_rs.yml)

A Rust implementation of tensor networks: TCI, Quantics Tensor Train, and Tree Tensor Networks.

Related project: [tenferro-rs](https://github.com/tensor4all/tenferro-rs) provides tensor backend components used by tensor4all-rs.

## Features

- **ITensors.jl-like dynamic tensors**: Flexible `Index` system with dynamic-rank `Tensor`
- **Tensor Cross Interpolation**: TCI2 primary algorithm plus legacy TCI1 compatibility for efficient high-dimensional function approximation
- **Quantics Tensor Train**: Binary encoding of continuous variables with transformation operators
- **Tree Tensor Networks**: Arbitrary topology with canonicalization, truncation, and contraction
- **C API**: Minimal Julia-facing FFI surface for indices, structured tensors, TreeTN, and quantics materialization

## Quick Start

The crates are not published to crates.io yet. Use git dependencies from an
external project:

```toml
[dependencies]
tensor4all-simplett = { git = "https://github.com/tensor4all/tensor4all-rs", package = "tensor4all-simplett" }
```

When working from a local checkout, use a path dependency instead:

```toml
[dependencies]
tensor4all-simplett = { path = "../tensor4all-rs/crates/tensor4all-simplett" }
```

```rust
use tensor4all_simplett::{AbstractTensorTrain, TensorTrain};

let tt = TensorTrain::<f64>::constant(&[2, 3, 4], 1.0);
assert!((tt.evaluate(&[0, 1, 2]).unwrap() - 1.0).abs() < 1e-12);
assert!((tt.sum() - 24.0).abs() < 1e-12);
```

The root `README.md` is kept intentionally short and its Rust snippets are
validated in CI. Longer runnable examples live in the
[User Guide](https://tensor4all.org/tensor4all-rs/).

## How to Cite

tensor4all-rs does not yet have a software paper of its own. If you use it
in research, please read the
[Provenance and Citation Policy](docs/PROVENANCE_AND_CITATION_POLICY.md)
and cite the original papers of the algorithms your work relies on, together
with the software papers of the upstream libraries those components build on
(for example the TCI paper,
[SciPost Phys. 18, 104 (2025)](https://doi.org/10.21468/SciPostPhys.18.3.104),
for the TCI components, and the ITensor paper,
[SciPost Phys. Codebases 4 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.21468/SciPostPhysCodeb.4),
for the tree tensor network components).
